# Hi there! 👋
I’m Nanang, your friendly neighborhood **Self-Taught Full-Stack Engineer** 🚀. I’ve been on this wild coding adventure since **2008**, and let me tell you, it’s been a rollercoaster of curly braces, semicolons, and late-night debugging sessions. But hey, that’s where the magic happens, right? ✨

## What’s in My Toolbox?
* **Front-End Sorcery**: I weave pixel-perfect spells with **CSS** and **Javascript**. Whether it’s crafting responsive layouts or conjuring interactive UIs, I’ve got you covered.
* **Alchemy Beyond Hype**: While others chase the latest buzzwords and trends, I delve deeper. I seek **practical magic**—the tools that fit the project like a well-worn cloak. Whether it’s a mystical Svelte incantation or a Cloudflare Workers enchantment, I choose wisely.
* **Code Compass**: My compass doesn’t point north; it points to the **most suitable solution**. Front-End? Serverless? I’ve danced with them all. **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** are my trusty wands, and **Svelte & SvelteKit**? Ah, they’re my favorite spells.
* **Serverless Enchantments**: Ever seen a server vanish into thin air? That’s my specialty! I wield the power of **Cloudflare Workers**, **Vercel**, **Firebase**, and **Supabase** to create cloud-native wonders.

## Join Me on This Quest!
Feel free to explore my repositories, peek at my code incantations, and maybe even drop a star or two. Let’s build magical software together! 🌟
